# Commodity-price-forecasting
Forecasting by using LSTM Neural Networks. 
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architecture that is widely used in time series forecasting.
This project uses the LSTM approach to forecast commodities or stock prices. The dataset is inserted from Yahoo-Finance.
All you need to do is add the commodity symbol in the command and select your appropriate time horizon by changing the dates.
By running the code you will get 1- The charts of actual and forecasted values. 2- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) that is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). 3- Predicted price.
